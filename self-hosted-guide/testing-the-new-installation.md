# Starting the Server

Once your server is installed you are ready to run it. In this example we will run it from bash. In the next chapters we will show you how to run the server behind a service manager such as PM2. 

## Start Server

```text
cd ~/btcp-explorer
./bitcore-node start
```

In digital ocean you might need to create a system link for node

 ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
{% endhint %}
