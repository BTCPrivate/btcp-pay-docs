# Getting Started

## Purpose of this guide

There are several ways to create a personal Bitcore dedicated instance for processing your BTCP payments online. This guide will cover the setup on a Digital Ocean Droplet & an AWS instance and the installation of Bitcore.  If you already have a server running with Ubuntu on Digital Ocean or AWS you can jump to the installation guide. 

Once you have Bitcore running you will be able to connect to it to process payments which we will cover in other chapters. 

{% hint style="info" %}
DigitalOcean calls its cloud servers Droplets; each Droplet you create is a new server for your personal use.
